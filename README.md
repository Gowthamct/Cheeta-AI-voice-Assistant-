Cheeta is a Python-based AI voice assistant designed for beginners. It provides real-time voice interaction and performs simple daily tasks through voice commands. The project features a JARVIS-inspired graphical interface with sound wave animations and a chat box for text interaction.

📌 Project Overview

Cheeta listens to user voice commands, responds naturally, and executes basic actions such as opening applications, checking live weather, performing math calculations, and playing Tamil songs only when requested. The assistant is built to demonstrate how voice recognition, APIs, and GUI design work together in a single application.
